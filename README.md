## 👋 Hi there, I am Myrto!

I am a senior year computer science student and I'm driven by a deep passion for computers, problem-solving, and exploring low-level matters!

🎓 I am currently studying **Informatics and Telecommunications** at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.<br />
🧑‍🏫 I'm a former **Programming Lab Assistant** focused on **MIPS Assembly** and Computer Architecture.
💻 Currently associated with **binary exploitation** and exploration of vulnerable programs as a part of my final-year dissertation.
🛠️ My favorite programming languages are **C** and **C++**.
💡 I debug for fun!
🎀 I love to break stereotypes in the IT community, proving that tech has room for every passion and personality!

Here are a few things I've picked up along my journey:
- C | C++ | Python
- Git | Github
- Docker
- MIPS assembly | x86 assembly
- Java | SQL
- Prolog | Haskell
- JavaScript | PHP | React.js | HTML | CSS
